title:  Julia 0.5 Release Announcement
author: The Julia Community
---

After over a year of development, the Julia community is proud to announce
the release of version 0.5 of the Julia language and standard library. This release contains
major language refinements and numerous standard library improvements.
A long list of changes is available in the
[NEWS log](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/NEWS.md#julia-v050-release-notes)
found in our main repository, with a summary reproduced below. A separate blog post detailing some 
of the [highlights of the new release](TODO) has also been posted

We'll be releasing regular regular bugfix backports 
from the 0.5.x line, which is reccomended for users requiring a stable language and API. 
Major feature work is ongoing on master for 0.6-dev.

The Julia ecosystem continues to grow, and there are now
[over one thousand](http://pkg.julialang.org/pulse.html) registered packages!.
The third annual [JuliaCon](http://juliacon.org/)  took place in  in Cambridge, MA in the [summer of 2016](http://julialang.org/blog/2016/09/juliacon2016), with an exciting line up
of talks and keynotes. Many of them are [available to view](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6SQPwZUDtAM59-wPzCPyD_S).

Binaries are available from the
[main download page](http://julialang.org/downloads/), or visit [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.com/)
to try this release from the comfort of your browser. Happy Coding!

***************************

**Notable compiler and language news:**

- The major focus of this release has been the ability to write fast functional code, removing the earlier performance penalty for
  anonymous functions and closures. This has been achieved via each function and closure now being its own type, and the captured variables 
  of a closure are fields of its type. All functions, including anonymous functions, are now generic and support all features. 
- The [return type of a function can now be specified](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/1090) in its definition using the syntax `function f()::T`. The return value of the
  function will automatically be converted to that type. 
- Experimental support for [multi threading](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/parallel-computing/#multi-threading-experimental) 
- All dimensions indexed by [scalars are now dropped](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/13612), 
  whereas previously only trailing scalar dimensions would be omitted from the result. This is a major breaking changes, but 
  has been made to make the indexing rules much more consistent. 
- Method ambiguities no longer generate warnings when files are loaded. Rather a call that cannot be resolved to a 
  single method results in a [MethodError at run time](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/6190).
- Various fixes to comprehensions, including determining the [type of the output(https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/7258),
  [preserving the dimensions](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/16622) of the input ranges, support for 
  [filtering](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/550) with `if`, and [nested iterations](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/4867)
  using multiple `for` keywords
- [Generator expressions](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/4470) now can create iterators that are computed only on demand. 
- Experimental support for [arrays whose indexing](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/16260) starts from values other than 1. 
- The assignment operations .+=, .*= and so on now now attempt to change the left hand side in-place, and will fail if the left-hand side 
   is immutable (or does not support view). 
- Major improvement to how [strings](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/16107) are created and stored.
- A [`@testset` macro](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/13062) allows grouping of tests and better error reporting. 
- [Package operations](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/11196) now use the `libgit2` library rather than shelling out to command line git. This makes these calls to package
  related functions much faster, and more reliable, especially on Windows. 
- And [many many more](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/NEWS.md#julia-v050-release-notes) changes and improvements...
