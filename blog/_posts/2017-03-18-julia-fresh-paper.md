Our paper titled [Julia: A Fresh Approach to Numerical Computing](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/141000671) was published in the prestigious [SIAM Review](https://www.siam.org/journals/sirev.php) in February 2017. While drafts of this paper have always been available on Arxiv, we are excited that the paper is finally published. We make an attempt to explain why Julia is fast while retaining ease of use and simultaneously also offer a tutorial for the reader to get a feel for the language.
