Our [paper](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/141000671) titled `Julia: A fresh approach to numerical computing` was published in the prestigious [SIAM Review](https://www.siam.org/journals/sirev.php) in February 2017. While drafts of this paper have always been available on Arxiv, we are excited that the paper is finally published in a journal. We make an attempt to explain why Julia is fast, while retaining ease of use and simultaneously also offer a tutorial for the reader to get a feel for the language. This is the definitive paper on Julia to cite in your own research, in addition to other papers listed in the Publications section.
